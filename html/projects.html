        <h2>2D Game Engine</h2>
        <p>
            As part of a semester-long project, I am implementing a comprehensive
            2D game engine from scratch using Java.
            My engine includes Systems to render game objects, handle user input,
            detect in-game collisions, and many more capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Essential to the implementation of this engine is an
            understanding of the flow of execution.

            In my design, program execution starts at the Application,
            then percolates through layers of increasing specificity and intricacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the journey of a single key press for example.
        </p>
        <p>

            When the user presses the 'a' key, the current running Application
            passes the event along to the GameWorld, current active Screen, and ViewPort.

            The GameWorld passes execution along to its Systems,
            which pass executions to specific behaviors, which in turn update the state
            of the GameObjects to which they belong.

            The Screen and ViewPort pass execution along in a similar fashion.
        </p>

        <p> I have built three games thus far on top of my engine:</p>
        <p><b>Tic Tac Toe:</b> a digital recreation of the classic game</p>
        <p><b>Alchemy:</b> my rendition of <a href="https://littlealchemy.com/" target="_blank">this game</a></p>
        <p><b>Paws off my Crops:</b> a work in progress involving tending to, and protecting, a farm.</p>

        <h2>Maps</h2>
        <p>Maps was a full-stack software engineering assignment.
            My partner and I were tasked with querying a database,
            parsing information, and rendering a map that displayed shortest routes.

      <div class="project" id="project2">
        <h2>Autocorrect</h2>
        <p>
            This was another full-stack engineering assignment that involved
            parsing data to build up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank">Trie</a> in order to be able to
            give real-time spelling suggestions to users as they typed.
