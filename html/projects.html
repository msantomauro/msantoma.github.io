        <h2>2D Game Engine</h2>
        <p>
            As part of a semester-long project, I am implementing a comprehensive
            2D game engine from scratch using Java.
            My engine includes Systems to render game objects, handle user input,
            detect in-game collisions, and many more capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the very first steps I took was understanding the
            something of execution in order
            to design the frameworks upon which my games would be built.
        </p>
        <p> I have built three games thus far on top of my engine:</p>
        <p><b>Tic Tac Toe:</b> my rendition of tic-tac-toe, which allows for multiple grid sizes!</p>
        <p><b>Alchemy:</b> my rendition of <a href="https://littlealchemy.com/" target="_blank">this delightful game</a></p>
        <p><b>Paws off my Crops:</b> a work in progress involving tending to, and protecting, produce</p>

        <h2>Maps</h2>
        <p>Maps was a full-stack software engineering assignment.
            My partner and I were tasked with querying a database,
            parsing information, and rendering a map that displayed shortest routes.
        </p>

        <h1>3.</h1>
        <h2>Autocorrect</h2>
        <p>
            This was another full-stack engineering assignment that involved
            parsing data to build up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank">Trie</a> in order to be able to
            give real-time spelling suggestions to users as they typed.
